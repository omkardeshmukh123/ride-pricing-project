## 5. Usage

1.  Run the API server from the root directory:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
2.  Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You should see the welcome message.

3.  To get a prediction, go to the interactive documentation at `http://12_7.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
    * Expand the `/predict` endpoint.
    * Click "Try it out."
    * Fill in the request body with ride details and click "Execute."

    **Example Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "distance_km": 10.5,
      "temperature_celsius": 32.0,
      "cab_type": "Sedan",
      "weather_condition": "Rainy",
